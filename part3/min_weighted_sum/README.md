## Minimize the weighted sum of completion times

## Q1
You are given sets of two integers which describe weight and length of a job.
The task is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the **difference** (weight - length).

## Q2
The task is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in decreasing order of the **ratio** (weight / length).
